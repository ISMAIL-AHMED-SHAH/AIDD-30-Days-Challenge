### 🌟 PART A — Research Questions (Short Answers)

1. What new improvements were introduced in Gemini 3.0?
Ans. Gemini 3.0 adds **Deep Think** for step-by-step reasoning, **native multimodal understanding** to handle text, images, audio, and video together, and stronger **agentic abilities** so it can plan and execute tasks independently.

2. How does Gemini 3.0 improve coding & automation workflows?
Ans. Gemini 3.0 introduces **Vibe Coding**, where you just describe how you want an app to "feel," and the AI instantly builds the interface. It also brings a stronger **agentic workflow**, meaning the AI works like a real partner, it can browse the web, run commands, debug code, and handle complex tasks on its own without needing constant instructions.

3. How does Gemini 3.0 improve multimodal understanding?
Ans. Unlike older models, Gemini 3.0 is **natively multimodal**—it can understand text, images, audio, and video together at the same time. This means you can show it a video of a coding bug or a screenshot of a complex dashboard, and it can instantly analyze everything in context, picking up details that text-only models would miss.

4. Name any two developer tools introduced with Gemini 3.0.
Ans.  1. **Google Antigravity:** A new "agentic" IDE (Integrated Development Environment) where the AI acts as a pro-active coding partner, handling background tasks and debugging.
      2. **Gemini CLI:** A command-line tool that brings Gemini 3.0 directly into your terminal to help with scripting and automation tasks.
