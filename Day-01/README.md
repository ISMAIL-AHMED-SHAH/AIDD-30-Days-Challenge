### My Thoughts on AI-Driven Development

**What does AI-Driven Development mean to you?**

To me, AI-Driven Development means working together with AI as a real partner. It's like having a co-pilot who helps me think clearly, write better code, and solve problems faster. Instead of just typing code line by line, I now focus on explaining what I want to build – and AI helps me build it. It feels less like giving commands to a computer and more like having a conversation with a very smart teammate who never gets tired and always has new ideas.

**How do you see the future of Human–AI Collaboration in software development?**

I imagine a future where humans and AI work together like a perfect team. Humans will focus on creativity, big-picture thinking, and understanding real-world problems – like why we're building something and who we're building it for. AI will handle the repetitive tasks, suggest better ways to build things, and help turn ideas into reality much faster.

It won't feel like we're being replaced – instead, we'll become more like directors guiding a talented crew. We'll say *"Here's what we need"* and AI will help with *"Here are ways we can do it."* Together, we'll build software that's smarter, more useful, and more human-centered than anything we could create alone.
